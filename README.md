# OBS Screen Switcher

With this Script, you're able to automatically switch between 2 Monitors (Both 1920x1080 Pixels)

## Installation

- Download the Script from Github
- Download AutoHotkey
- Create 2 Seperate Scenes for your Monitors in OBS
- Go to the Settings and bind `F23` for the first and `F24` for the second Monitor Scene
- Run the Script and Enjoy :)

## Settings

- You can change the 500 in the Script to any other time for example 1000 = 1sec
- You can change the "F23" and "F24" to other Hotkeys if you want to 

## Extras

- I would recommend using "Slide" Transition in OBS to make smoother Transition between both Monitors
